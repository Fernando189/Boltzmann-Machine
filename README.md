# Boltzmann-Machine
Implementation of Boltzmann Machine used for Shifter Problem, as introduced by Hinton and Sejnowski 1984,
as well as a script that tests the learning. (Boltzmann.py and BoltzmannTest.py)
In Boltzmann2.py we add different types of inputs (maximally ambiguous and biased ambiguous)
and similarly, BoltzmannTest2.py is the script that tests the learning on these inputs
